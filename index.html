                        In 2017, members of a Hunter College High School club
                        called Code 4 Change held the original HawkHacks. It was
                        a day-long hacking and coding event held at Hunter
                        College High School. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
                        another HCHS club called Hunter Data Analytics for
                        Change—whose board includes one original member of
                        C4C—revived the competition and hosted HawkHacks 2021!
                        Then a guy named Enbyte, showed up, revived the club,
                        got its econ-team loving president impeached and got 
                        him to come to meetings! Maybe you guys should proofread
                        the website a little harder next time. Now, the club is 
                        made up of around 15 people who are working hard to get
                        HawkHacks 2023 up and running!
