                        In 2017, members of a Hunter College High School club
                        called Code 4 Change held the original HawkHacks. It was
                        a day-long hacking and coding event held at Hunter
                        College High School. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
                        another HCHS club called Hunter Data Analytics for
                        Change—whose board includes one original member of
                        C4C—revived the competition and hosted HawkHacks 2021!
