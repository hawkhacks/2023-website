                        HawkHacks will be hosted over Zoom this year! Throughout
                        the weekend, we will host workshops, provide online and
                        offline mentorship, and set aside working periods for
                        teams to develop their solutions. We’ve been lucky
                        enough to have amazing professionals working in tech,
                        finance, and investing join us to speak and mentor teams
                        at our past events! We’ll be sure to bring some amazing
                        speakers again this year. Many of our organizers have
                        also participated in hackathons in the past, so we will
                        offer our input as well! See the [schedule](#schedule)
                        above for more details on how the weekend will shape up.

                    In 2017, members of a Hunter College High School club called
                    Code 4 Change held the original HawkHacks. It was a day-long
                    hacking and coding event held at Hunter College High School.
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, another HCHS club called
                    Hunter Data Analytics for Change—whose board includes one
                    original member of C4C—revived the competition and hosted
                    HawkHacks 2021!
